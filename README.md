#About Us
This repository is just a place to allow us to describe Team Practical Projects.

##What are we doing?

It's hard to write a full manifesto, but we did write a few words that capture our motivation. If you like this, then why not collaborate with us?

**Complete**.  We offer plans and documentation for complete projects.Complete means that we thoroughly document everything that we have done.  We offer complete plans for building, testing, installing, and operating the projects that we create. Our projects are complete as well, in as much as we offer printed circuit boards for electronics (not breadboards) and plans for finished enclosures that are functional as well as decorative and protective.  

**Practical**.  Our projects have practical applications. They perform real functions aimed at real needs. Our designs are practical as well, in as much as they can be built for a reasonable cost, all parts are readily available to hobbyists, and they are completely open source.

**Solution**.  We offer solutions to real world problems. These are not toys or demonstrations.  They are complete solutions to these problems.

**Project**.  We offer projects, not products.The user must plan, procure, assemble, test, install and deploy the project. We provide complete, tested documentation to do so. We offer no warranty of any kind. The project builder must make sure the project is suitable for their deployment.

**Open**.  Our projects are completely open source. They are released under [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) for people to enjoy, learn and improve upon.  

**Step-by-step**.  Our projects come complete with step by step instructions for assembly and installation. They are appropriate for novices as well as advanced hobbyists and professionals.

**Team**.  Our organization is a team of open source developer. We are not a company nor a supplier. We hope our projects improve some small parts of the world.
